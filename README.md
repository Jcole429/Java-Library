# Java-Library
FDU Object Oriented Programming project

A library bookkeeping system that allows a library to digitalize their check-in and check-out system. There are two types of users: admin and user. Users are able to browse the books that the library has available to them by either scrolling through the books or searching specifically for what they want. Users will have their own profile that displays all of the books they currently have checked out. From their profile, they could also choose to check books back in. Admin users are able to do everything a user can, with the addition of being able to create new books and also create new copies or delete copies of books. This JavaFX application will be able to meet the needs of any library that is looking to digitalize their bookkeeping system.
